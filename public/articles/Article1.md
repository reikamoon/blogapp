#Creating Your Own Blog
<b>by reikamoon :ribbon:</b>

<p>
Blogs are an excellent way to express yourself and tell the world who you are. As an aspiring software engineer, I believe that coding is another great way to express yourself and gives you a lot of creative freedom! <br>
I created this blog using <b>React.js, Node.js,</b> and <b>MongoDB</b> for the database.<br>
<br>
For the front end, I chose <b>React</b>. I enjoy working with react because of how flexible and simple it is. I especially like being able to reuse components.
